All reference proteomes should be placed in this folder (in fasta format).
Reference proteomes are used for mapping peptides to their reference proteins when computing netchop scores.

Minimum required files: 
HUMAN_9606.fasta     - The whole human proteome
thymus_max60.fasta   - This file contains a subset of the human proteome expressed in the thymus
HIV-1_11706.fasta    - The proteome of a HIV-1 strain
